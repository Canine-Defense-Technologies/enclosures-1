# K-TAC Rugged T-Beam Enclosure 1


K-TAK RTE-1 (Ruggedized T-Beam Enclosure 1) is an open sourced ruggedized tactical enclosure for the t beam m8n. RTE-1 is deisgned to help bring meshtastic to the roughest outdoor conditions in a small man portable package. With one of the primary design goals inculding a large battery compartment, RTE-1 is compatible with a large enough battery for days of coninuous operation without

## IMPORTANT NOTICE


1. This is not a beginner friendly enclosure! If this is your first enclosure, we highly do not recommend if you would like to check out more beginner friendly enclosures at: https://github.com/meshtastic/enclosures This project requires a intermediate knowledge in electronics, itermediate skill level in soldering, 3D printing, and CNC machining

2. Do not proceed with this project until you have gotten Meshtastic working on the t-beam first! This enclosure requires a lot of semi-permanent modifications that will make debugging very tricky.

3. The water resistance should be treated as a “Safety” feature! Although the enclosure performed flawlessly in our testing in extremely wet environments, the effectiveness of the seal is dependent on how the enclosure is assembled and the assemblers experience. If you do not have experience waterproofing enclosures, do not attempt to submerge or wet this enclosure. If you are confident in the seal, operate at your own ris

4. THIS CAN CAUSE PERMANENT DAMAGE TO YOUR T-BEAM IF YOU. Steps such as the rewiring of the USB

## Material

Carbon fiber/Polycarbonate 3D printer filament (PETG or ABS could also work)

1x Roll of Double Sided Sticky Tape

1x RTV Sealer (Most should work, we used JB Weld Ultimate Black)

1x 5 min epoxy (We like JB Weld)

1x Roll of Painters Tape

1x Roll of 

1x 2.7 mm polycarbonate sheet (Acrylic could also work, for our U.S. folks the generic small squares of lexan sheets sold at Home Depot are roughly 2.7mm and should work)

1x 1 or 2 mm carbon fiber sheet (Optional but recommended) 

8x M3 brass threaded inserts

## Screws 

(It’s much cheaper to buy a screw kit online, stainless steel is highly recommended) 

6x M3x12 Socket Head Cap machine screws

2x M3x6 Socket Head Cap machine screws

4x M3x5 Round head cap machine screws

4x M3x10 Round head cap machine screws

If you do not own a CNC, you can 

## Non CNC Version

Don't own a CNC? No worries! We deisgned a version that utilizes the armoured elemnts to be simply printed. For the clear acrulic or polycarboante screen protector however, you will need to cut it out by hand using the included . Note the template must be 3D printed. Paper templates varry in scale by printers and are not reliable neough.
