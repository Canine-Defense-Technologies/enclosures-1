# K-TAC Rugged T-Beam Enclosure 1

![K-TAC RTE 1 wireframe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101295892/159145646-d8206180-4656-4461-9e1e-7b50228de056.png)

K-TAK RTE-1 (Ruggedized T-Beam Enclosure 1) is an open sourced ruggedized tactical enclosure for the t beam m8n. RTE-1 is designed to help bring meshtastic to the roughest outdoor conditions in a small man portable package. RTE-1 was designed around a large battery compartment ensuring space for a high capacity battery; this will allow days of continuous operation on a single charge. It also utilizes commercially available waterproof components to offer a weatherproof and completely sealed body, protecting the electronics from the elements. Though not a beginner friendly project, RTE-1 is relatively a simple construction. The body is 3D printed with cnc cutout "armor" panels for added protection and strength. However the CNC parts are not necessary and can be substituted with printed parts. The CNCed parts are relatively simple, with a drill press and good saw (and skill) it can be cut out by hand

## IMPORTANT NOTICE


1. This is not a beginner friendly enclosure! If this is your first enclosure, we highly do not recommend if you would like to check out more beginner friendly enclosures at: https://github.com/meshtastic/enclosures This project requires a intermediate knowledge in electronics, intermediate skill level in soldering, 3D printing, and CNC machining

2. Do not proceed with this project until you have gotten Meshtastic working on the t-beam first! This enclosure requires a lot of semi-permanent modifications that will make debugging very tricky.

3. The water resistance should be treated as a “Safety” feature! Although the enclosure performed flawlessly in our testing in extremely wet environments, the effectiveness of the seal is dependent on how the enclosure is assembled and the assembler's experience. If you do not have experience waterproofing enclosures, do not attempt to submerge or wet this enclosure. If you are confident in the seal, operate at your own ris

4. THIS CAN CAUSE PERMANENT DAMAGE TO YOUR T-BEAM! Steps such as the rewiring of the USB or desoldering the battery tray can damage your T-Beam if done improperly. It is highly recommended to gain experience with other projects first before proceeding with this one

## 3D Printing Info
Inculded are 2 versions, one for FDM and one for SLA. The only difference is how the screws mount, for the FDM version the holes ar elarger to accomidate threaded heat set inserts, whereas the SLA version has 3 mm holes intended to be tapped straight into the resin print itself. For full rugged perofmance, FDM pritning is favored over resin printing, hwoever for more moderate usage resin prints should also work (Indoor, casual hiking, urban enviroemtn, ect.).

FDM Reccomended Settings:

100% infill

0.2 mm layer height minimun

PETG, Polycarboante, or ABS

## Tools

3D Printer (The body is printed)

CNC Mill (See below if you do not own one)

Wire Snips

Soldering Iron (And basic soldering skills)

M3 Taps (Only needed for resin print version)



## Electronics

1x TTGO T-BEAM M8N

1x OLED Display

2x 12 mm stainlee steel waterproof push button (generic, make sure it's momentary)

1x Upgraded Antenna (stock antenna could work but not recommended)

1x 25mm GPS Antenna (stock antenna could work but not recommended)

2x Li Ion 21700 (Optional, other li ion cells pouch or even 18650s could work, but who dosen’t want to cram the biggest cell this enclosure will take right?)
https://www.18650batterystore.com/collections/21700-batteries/products/samsung-50e

1x Set of male and female XT-30 Connectors (Optional, but these are our preferred battery connectors. Directly soldering to the board will work but is not recommended) 

1x Roll of this silicone wire (Make sure it’s thin)
https://www.adafruit.com/product/3164

1x Roll of thicker gauge silicone wire for battery (Depends on what your cell specs are) 

1x Waterproof Panel Mount Micro USB

1x micro usb male breakout (4 pin, 5 pin could also work, just ignore the extra connection)



## Material

Carbon fiber/Polycarbonate 3D printer filament (PETG or ABS could also work)

1x Roll of Double Sided Sticky Tape

1x RTV Sealer (Most should work, we used JB Weld Ultimate Black)

1x 5 min epoxy (We like JB Weld)

1x Roll of Painters Tape

1x 2.7 mm polycarbonate sheet (Acrylic could also work, for our U.S. folks the generic small squares of lexan sheets sold at Home Depot are roughly 2.7mm and should work)

1x 1 or 2 mm carbon fiber sheet (Optional but recommended) 

8x M3 brass threaded inserts (Not needed for the SLA resin printed version)

## Screws 

(It’s much cheaper to buy a screw kit online, stainless steel is highly recommended) 

6x M3x12 Socket Head Cap machine screws

2x M3x6 Socket Head Cap machine screws

4x M3x5 Round head cap machine screws

4x M3x10 Round head cap machine screws

## Non CNC Version

Don't own a CNC? No worries! We designed a version that utilizes the armored elements to be simply printed.

For the clear poycarbonate or acrylic peice, inculded is a 3D Printable template. Simply print, align to your plexiglass sheet, and cut and dril out the holes by hand with a dremel and drill
